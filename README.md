## Introduction
This is the first portfolio project from the Full Stake Engineer Path on Codecademy. The project goal is to produce a new and randomized output every time a user runs a program. The program should output at least three different pieces of data. The project will be created in a personalized development environment, outside of the Codecademy learning suite.

For this project, the intent is to randomly select an array value in 3 arrays to generate a randomly generated sentence. The types of arrays will include:
* Animal
* Verb
* Purpose
These array values will be referenced in a string and printed to the console.

## Technologies
This project uses the Javascript language to code the program, and markdown language to formal the README.md file.

## Examples of use
Screenshots will be added once the program is running correctly.

## Project status 
Project was started on January 22nd. and is planned to be completed by January 23rd.
